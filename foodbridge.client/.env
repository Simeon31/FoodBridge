# Environment variables for FoodBridge client
# Vite only exposes variables prefixed with VITE_
# Choose ONE of the following configurations by uncommenting:

#1) Use dev proxy defined in vite.config.js (recommended for local dev)
VITE_API_URL=/api

#2) Direct call to HTTPS backend (skip proxy) - requires valid dev cert
# VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:7066/api

#3) Direct call to HTTP backend (if HTTPS not available)
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5231/api

#4) Production example (replace with actual domain)
# VITE_API_URL=https://api.foodbridge.yourdomain.com/api

# Notes:
# - When building for production the proxy settings in vite.config.js are not used.
# - Ensure backend CORS policy includes the frontend origin when using full URLs.
# - Relative '/api' works when frontend and backend share the same origin or when dev proxy is active.
